# AnnoPilot Development Handoff

Last verified: 2026-10-03, approximately 11:18 Asia/Bangkok.

## 1. Project Goal
Dataset → Import/normalize → Media + Annotation Analysis → Difficulty → Dataset Health → Smart Sampling → Workload → Reviewer Priority → Human Review → CSV Export.
Difficulty estimates review effort/complexity, never correctness. Human review alone records No Issue or Issue Found. Production data must come from user uploads.

## 2. Working Directory
F:\VinAI\Workspace\Tool\AnnoPilot. Initially empty; no existing source, handoff or project/inspected-parent AGENTS instructions found. Project built directly here, no nested checkout. Runtime paths are portable.

## 3. Architecture
React19/Vite6/TypeScript/Tailwind4/Recharts/Lucide frontend. Python/FastAPI/Pydantic/SQLAlchemy/SQLite backend. Local Python3.9.6; Docker Python3.11. Flexible JSON geometry, four parser strategies and four BaseDifficultyAnalyzer strategies. Shared deterministic sampling, greedy effort balancing, independent reviewer queues. Synchronous local CPU analysis; no external AI/cloud/job infrastructure.

## 4. Current Project Structure
- frontend/src: App.tsx, api.ts, types.ts, main.tsx, style.css
- frontend: package.json/lock, vite.config.ts, tsconfig.json, postcss.config.js, index.html, Dockerfile, nginx.conf
- backend/app: main.py, database/, models/, schemas/, parsers/, analyzers/, services/pipeline.py, routers/api.py
- backend/tests: conftest.py, test_parsers.py, test_analysis.py, test_api.py, ui_fixture/labels.xml and README.md
- backend: requirements.txt, pytest.ini, Dockerfile
- root: README.md, HANDOFF.md, Start-AnnoPilot.ps1, docker-compose.yml, .gitignore
- uploads/, exports/: gitkeep plus ignored user runtime files
Ignored: venv, node_modules, npm cache, builds, databases, test runtime stores, logs, uploads/exports.

## 5. Implemented
- Unified dataset/sample/annotation/analysis model with BBOX_2D, POLYGON, MASK, KEYPOINT, CUBOID_3D and MIXED tasks. Attributes, nullable occlusion and source metadata preserved: models/ and parsers/.
- CVAT, COCO, YOLO detection, KITTI strategies; invalid individual shapes warned/skipped; malformed/empty documents handled.
- Multipart/ZIP uploads, bounded extraction, traversal/symlink rejection, format/task detection, media matching, missing media retained: services/pipeline.py, routers/api.py.
- OpenCV blur/exposure/contrast/edges/entropy, task-specific annotation features, availability/reasons, weight renormalization and actual contributions: analyzers/.
- Configurable weight groups and thresholds; save recalculates all datasets atomically. Revision mismatch exposes Needs Regeneration for existing plans.
- Seven connected frontend pages: real statistics/charts, filters/sort/20-row client pagination, scaling SVG box/polygon/keypoint/label overlays, properties and scoring explanation.
- Count/percentage seeded QC selection, deduplication, explicit coverage fallback; reviewer creation/removal guards; greedy QC-subset balancing; independent priority queues.
- No Issue, Issue Found, Skip, persisted notes, next PENDING sample. Historical results retained across regeneration.
- Three UTF-8-BOM CSV exports with requested columns and formula-text escaping.
- Dataset deletion confirmation, cascades, complete upload-folder cleanup via additive storage_key migration.
- Dockerfiles/Compose/Nginx, local hidden-process start script and comprehensive README.

## 6. Partially Implemented
| Feature | What works | Remaining / next action / files |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COCO RLE masks | Original RLE retained; count/rarity available | Validated decoder, geometry metrics and overlay. parsers/, analyzers/, App.tsx. Never claim current rendering. |
| 3D sensors | KITTI parse/score/QC/metadata review; BIN/PCD retained/matched | Decode point cloud, calibration transforms/density and optional viewer. parsers/, analyzers/, pipeline.py, App.tsx. |
| Import progress | Busy/loading messages, disabled actions | Optional actual stage progress/background job for large imports; no invented percentages. |
| Large dataset browsing | Fetch all summaries, paginate20 client rows | Server-side filtering/pagination if needed. |
| Docker verification | Compose config validates, proxy/healthcheck/volumes implemented | Unpause engine, free3000/8000, build/start and smoke-test. |
These limits are described accurately in README/UI; core local workflow works.

## 7. Not Started
Future/non-goals: CVAT video tracks/skeletons/raster masks, YOLO pose/segmentation, articulated pose viewer, advanced 3D viewer, login/RBAC and internet deployment hardening. Do not add auto-label/model training/chatbots to MVP.

## 8. Supported Annotation Tasks
| Task | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BBox2D | TESTED | CVAT/COCO/YOLO, tiny/overlap/known occlusion/rarity |
| Polygon segmentation | TESTED | CVAT/COCO, area/vertices/envelope crowding; RLE partial |
| Keypoint | TESTED | CVAT points/COCO visibility; unknown visibility stays unknown |
| Cuboid3D | TESTED | KITTI geometry/metadata/available scoring; calibrated sensor features unavailable |
| Mixed | TESTED | Per-task analyzers combined by annotation counts |

## 9. Supported Formats
| Format | Status | Tasks | Limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVAT images XML | TESTED | Boxes/polygons/points/mixed | Attributes/occlusion; video tracks unsupported |
| COCO JSON | TESTED | Boxes/polygons/keypoints | RLE retained without decoder; multiple rings count as separate normalized shapes |
| YOLO TXT | TESTED | Detection BBox | Five fields, matching image required, optional classes.txt |
| KITTI TXT | TESTED | Cuboid3D |15+ fields; rectified camera frame/bottom-center preserved; DontCare excluded |
Unit parser and multipart upload/analysis integration tests exercised all implemented formats. JPG/JPEG/PNG decoded; BIN/PCD retained but not decoded/visualized.

## 10. Difficulty Implementation
Source: backend/app/analyzers/__init__.py. Defaults/validation: backend/app/schemas/__init__.py.
Each feature: normalized[0,1] value, raw, available, reason_if_unavailable. Score =100*available weighted sum/available weight sum. Missing is excluded, not zero. All missing =None.
Visual: Laplacian blur1/(1+variance/100) .30; brightness deviation .25; low contrast .20; Canny density/.2 .15; histogram entropy/8 .10. Longest image side capped1600 for compute.
BBox: count capped20 .20; tiny .25; known occlusion .20; unique IoU pairs .20; rare .15.
Polygon: count .20; tiny .20; vertices capped50 .25; envelope crowding .20; rare .15. Shoelace area; envelope crowding is a proxy, not polygonIoU. Occlusion metadata informational. RLE geometry metrics unavailable.
Keypoint: count .20; known missing .25; known occluded .25; visible pose-envelope crowding .15; rare .15. Unknown visibility not invented.
Cuboid: count .20; known occlusion .20; source truncation .20; center pairs within5m .15; rare .15; sparsity .10 unavailable. Density/distance/projection have explicit unavailable reasons.
Tiny ratio<.01; overlapIoU>.30; rare frequency<.05 across ALL dataset annotations; configurable. Pairwise metrics above2000 instances unavailable to bound CPU cost.
Mixed score: count-weighted mean of available task scores. Overall .70 annotation/.30 visual, renormalized. Measured empty annotation list scores0. Clamp0–100; EASY<40, MEDIUM<70, HARD>=70, UNAVAILABLE when no available weighted source. Stored contributions reconstruct actual score within rounding tolerance; tested with images and all formats.
Full formula table in README. Never use score as error probability.

## 11. Database
Default root annopilot.db (ignored), persisted on restart. Tables: datasets/samples/annotations/analysis_results/settings/sampling_runs/sample_selections/reviewers/review_assignments. ReviewResult represented by assignment status/note fields. Dataset storage_key enables folder cleanup; additive migration preserves prior schema.
Production API returned[] after final restart; no fixtures/reviewers were seeded. Browser test stores are isolated under backend/tests/ui_fixture; pytest temporary stores are removed on completion. Docker named database volume is separate from local DB. Back up database and uploads together.

## 12. API
Router backend/app/routers/api.py; health/api/health; Swagger/docs. Covers datasets/upload/delete/samples/media/settings/recalculate/sampling/reviewers/balance/assignments/queues/status/notes/exports. README route matrix is accurate. Empty browser media fields tolerated; nonempty non-file media rejected. Invalid requests get readable422/409/404 messages.

## 13. Frontend
App.tsx contains seven views and upload/detail dialogs. api.ts handles backend errors, types.ts payloads, style.css responsive dark navy/cyan layout. SVG overlays scale with image stage. Features/contributions and unavailable reasons exposed. Errors visible within dialogs. Chart code split into separate production chunk.
Chrome browser test used separate frontend3001/API8001 with SQLite/uploads/exports under backend/tests. Verified landing, upload dialog, CVAT fixture import WITHOUT media, real computed dashboard, two-sample QC selection, reviewer addition, balancing, priority queue, Issue Found+note, next sample, persistence after reload, No Issue and queue completion. Production empty landing and all settings groups inspected on3000. No production mock data.
Chrome production tab left open as deliverable at http://localhost:3000. Screenshot saved outside repo in chat visualization folder.

## 14. Tests
Executed 2026-10-03 about11:17 Bangkok:
Command: cd backend; .venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest -q
Result:39 passed,0 failed,1.66s.
Command: .venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pip check
Result:No broken requirements found.
Coverage: parsers/finite geometry, malformed imports/ZIP, image matching, visual features/blur, tiny/rarity/unique overlap, polygon/keypoint/cuboid availability, missing-weight renormalization, mixed deterministic scoring/contributions, budget/deduplication/fallback, greedy balancing/unknown-score rejection, all-format uploads, full review/export persistence, saved-results preservation, stale plans and empty optional media fields.
Earlier greedy test expected a tighter-than-guaranteed optimum; corrected to documented LPT behavior (120vs150) and largest-job bound. Empty-media regression exposed multipart string-vs-file handling; fixed. Latest full run has no failures.

## 15. Frontend Build
Final npm run build:PASS, TypeScript+Vite,7.46s. MainJS254.79kB, chart chunk423kB, CSS20.42kB. No oversized/empty chunk warning in final build. Latest npm installation reported0 vulnerabilities after Tailwind4.3.3 upgrade removed vulnerable Tailwind3 braces/micromatch chain. package-lock committed.
Vite/esbuild needed sandbox escalation due spawnEPERM; source build succeeded. No source-build failure remains.

## 16. Known Bugs
No known failing core-workflow tests. Scope limits in sections6/7 and README. No RLE/advanced3D rendering claimed. Synchronous analysis and whole-summary client fetch can be slow at scale. Local trusted-workspace use only, no auth. Reviewer removal/rebalancing blocked if it would erase saved reviews; start new subset to rebalance.

## 17. Current Blocking Issue
Docker runtime verification ONLY. docker version returned 'Docker Desktop is manually paused. Unpause it through the Whale menu or Dashboard.' docker compose config --quiet passed. Did not alter user's pause state/restart their containers.
Exact next action:unpause Docker, free ports3000/8000, docker compose up --build; check health/proxy/Swagger. All local core implementation/install/test/build/run work verified. No approval-review rejection occurred.

## 18. Exact Next Steps
- [ ] After Docker unpause, verify container build/start and routes localhost3000,/api/health,localhost8000/docs. Local MVP already works.
- [ ] Upload user-owned real data and evaluate heuristics at domain scale; user provided no dataset in this session.
- [ ] Optional future:validated RLE/calibrated point-cloud analysis/server pagination.

## 20. Important Design Decisions
1. Human judgment/source data authoritative; difficulty never writes findings.
2. JSON geometry plus parser/analyzer strategies keep QC pipeline independent of task/format.
3. Missing visibility/calibration stays unavailable. Available weights renormalize; balancing refuses unavailable effort rather than treating it as zero load.
4. Revisioned sampling/assignment preserves history. Historical review export includes prior runs; sample may appear once per run.
5. Greedy balancing deterministic, not globally optimal. Saved reviews prevent destructive reviewer removal/rebalance; start new run.
6. Count caps/CPU/file extraction limits prevent runaway local resource use. No invented advanced metrics.
7. All fixtures only in isolated backend/tests storage; production remains empty.
8. greenlet3.1.1 pinned because original resolver selected source build requiring absent C++ tools onPython3.9; venv pip upgraded.
9. Portable relative runtime paths. The post-build request now authorizes commit/push to the user-specified origin; see section 24.

## 21. Files to Read First
HANDOFF.md; README.md; backend/app/main.py; backend/app/database/__init__.py; backend/app/models/__init__.py; backend/app/schemas/__init__.py; backend/app/parsers/__init__.py; backend/app/analyzers/__init__.py; backend/app/services/pipeline.py; backend/app/routers/api.py; backend/tests/test_api.py; backend/tests/test_analysis.py; frontend/src/App.tsx; frontend/src/api.ts; docker-compose.yml.

## 22. Git Status
Git initialized; inherited configured identity used. Original implementation checkpoint: dea7ee3 — Build AnnoPilot local annotation review MVP; documentation checkpoint a77ae2c. Origin is now https://github.com/TMTower18/AnnoPilot.git, supplied by the user. Active branch master; origin was empty when fetched. Runtime stores/media/logs/dependencies/builds remain ignored. Git metadata requires sandbox escalation because .git is read-only in the sandbox. Run git status, git log -5 --oneline and git ls-remote origin refs/heads/master for authoritative commit/push state. Original npm audit reported 0 vulnerabilities. Compose config and frontend/Swagger/proxy health checks passed; production datasets still [].

## 23. Resume Instruction
New Codex session:
1.Read this entire HANDOFF.md.
2.Inspect Files to Read First.
3.Run git status and git log -5 --oneline.
4.Verify actual source before assuming handoff is correct.
5.Source and current test results are source of truth.
6.Start first unfinished item under Exact Next Steps.
7.Do not rebuild completed functionality unless verification shows it is broken.
8.Update HANDOFF.md after meaningful progress.

## 24. Post-build dataset guard and appearance (2026-10-03)

Implemented reusable DatasetRequiredRoute and accessible DatasetRequiredDialog, with dynamic feature names, Cancel/Escape/focus handling and direct Upload Dataset CTA. Sidebar stays clickable. URL navigation covers /, /dashboard, /dataset, /difficulty, /smart-sampling, /workload, /review-queue and /settings with browser history. Protected pages wait for dataset status; backend failures show Unable to check dataset status and Retry instead of a missing-data prompt. Home/upload and Settings remain usable without a dataset. Successful upload resumes the requested feature. Existing scoring, import, sampling, balancing, review and export code is preserved.

AppearanceProvider centralizes Light/Dark/System (default System) and Small/Medium/Large (default Medium), validates and persists localStorage preferences, listens to live prefers-color-scheme changes, handles storage failures and synchronizes storage events. Initialization precedes React rendering. Semantic CSS palette tokens replace hardcoded UI colors; rem typography scales globally (14/16/18px root). Settings uses labelled native radio groups with visible checked states and keyboard focus. Charts/tooltips use palette tokens; layouts wrap and tables scroll at larger sizes.

Changed frontend/src/App.tsx, main.tsx, style.css; added appearance.css, appearance/AppearanceProvider.tsx, components/AppearanceSettings.tsx, components/DatasetRequiredRoute.tsx, hooks/usePageNavigation.ts and scripts/verify-appearance.cjs. README documents navigation and preferences. No backend, dependency or scoring changes.

Verification: frontend npm run build succeeded; backend pytest 39 passed. Focused Node appearance lifecycle check passed defaults, persistence, live System changes in both directions, explicit override, invalid preference fallback and listener cleanup. Browser verified all six sidebar prompts and direct URLs, Cancel/Escape, upload CTA, Settings without data, Light/Dark/System and all three font sizes, immediate updates and reload persistence. Light/Large screenshot saved in the chat visualization folder outside repository. Browser observed separate loading states; an isolated proxy targeting an unavailable API verified the error/Retry state and independent Appearance settings. Existing isolated ui_fixture dataset opened Dashboard, Dataset, Difficulty, Smart Sampling, Workload and Review Queue without guards, preserving existing plans/reviews. Production database remained empty; no demo data inserted.

Only temporary test servers on 3001/3002/8001 are used for regression checks and stopped afterward; production ports 3000/8000 remain running. Browser preferences restored to System/Medium. Docker verification remains outstanding because Desktop is manually paused, as recorded above. No additional product blocker identified. Commit/push authorized to origin master, without force push; verify actual Git output for the final hash.
